<h3>First steps</h3>
    <p> Before doing anything else, make sure that no
        one is hurt. If they are, then ring the emergency
        services immediately. Try to keep calm – you may be stunned by the crash but take some deep breaths to
        get your head round what’s just happened. Act calmly and things will be easier to sort out – panic or
        anger won’t help. If the car’s still moving after the collision and you feel you have the car under
        control, you could be suffering from shock – you must stop the car and exchange details with the other
        driver. It is also a legal requirement to stop if a vehicle or any other property has been damaged.
        Consider whether the crash site is a hazard. Did the accident take place on a blind bend or hill? Get
        passers-by to warn any approaching cars until the emergency services arrive to clear the scene. Call 999
        if the wreckage could be a danger to any other drivers and call the police if anyone involved in the
        crash tries to leave the scene.</p>

<h3>The other driver</h3>
 <p>The shock of a crash is bad enough but of course
        it may be made even worse if the other driver is
        angry or potentially violent. But don’t let a raving driver bully you into taking the blame. Wherever
        the
        fault might lie, you should never admit liability – that’s something for your insurer or even the police
        to
        work out. Try to defuse the situation – remain calm and neutral, and focus the driver’s attention on
        other
        things, such as helping to make the accident scene safe. If the driver approaches you with money, and
        says
        that there’s no need for the insurance people to get involved, you should refuse them. It’s also worth
        noting if there was anything untoward about the crash. Had the other driver been holding a mobile just
        before the accident? Can you smell alcohol on his breath? Be discreet, don’t confront him, but do tell
        the
        police when they arrive.</p>


<h3>Gathering Evidence</h3>
<p>     OK, so the boys in blue
        are the experts, but what if it’s a minor crash and they’re not
        needed? Time to play detective – make a detailed sketch of the scene. Note the exact location of
        vehicles
        and damage, road layout, street names, and the colour, make and number plates of cars involved in the
        accident. If there are witnesses, get their details too – at the time things may look straightforward
        but
        you could get a surprise if you don’t get backup. What about the fool who reverses out of a space
        without
        looking and you hit him? He’s to blame, you think, until he tells his insurers he was stationary and you
        drove into the back of him…If you’re playing the professional, keep a camera in the car and photograph
        the
        entire scene. You might feel you’re overdoing it carrying a notebook and camera but these steps will
        help
        your car insurance claim go quickly, smoothly and fairly.</p>



<h3>Exchanging details</h3>
<p>Fussing about with exchanging details may be
        the last thing on your mind when your beloved motor has just
        been trashed, but it’s the law and can help protect you further down the line. It makes sense to
        exchange as
        many details as possible. You must exchange your car registration number, name and address, and details
        of
        the registered keeper if different from the driver. We also recommend you exchange phone numbers. If the
        police are at the scene, you’ll have to show them your car insurance document. If it’s not in the car at
        the
        time, you should take it to your local police station within seven days. You should also take down the
        other
        driver’s registration number in case they’ve given you a phoney name – the police can trace the owner
        with
        that information.</p>

    <p>If you’ve caused an accident without anyone else being involved, such as hitting a wall, fence or parked
        car,
        you should report the incident to the police as soon as it’s safe to do so, taking all of the paperwork
        and
        information above with you.</p>
